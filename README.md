This project is a more developed version of the project given to me by our school. With this tool, you can perform many image processing operations.
The operations you can perform with the Image Processing Tool are:
->GRAYSCALE IMAGE  
->NEGATIVE IMAGE
->BLACK-WHITE IMAGE
->BINARY IMAGE
->HISTOGRAM EQ
->HISTOGRAM VISUALIZER
->ZOOM IN/OUT
->CROPING
->GAUS FILTER
->SHARPNESS FILTER
->EDGE DETECTION
->KONTRAAHARMONIC FILTER
->MEAN FILTER
->DILATION
->EROTION
->SKELETONIZATION (ONLY 8BPP IMAGE)
However, you can add noises on your image:
->UNIFORM NOISE
->EXPONENTIAL NOISE
->GAUS NOISE
->SALT-PEPPER NOISE


Finally, you can save image as PNG, JPG, TIFF or BMP.
